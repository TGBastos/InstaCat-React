# Sample React App

The app have been dev with Expo, an web stack to code react apps.

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli)).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack).
